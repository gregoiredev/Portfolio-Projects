# SQL and Python Portfolio #

This portfolio showcases my proficiency in utilizing SQL and Python for data manipulation and analysis. It includes a variety of projects that highlight my ability to extract, clean, transform, and analyze data from diverse sources.

## Projects ## 
### Nashvile Housing ###
This project utilized SQL to perform data cleaning on a Nashville housing dataset, with the goal of improving the quality and reliability of the data. The project involved identifying and handling missing values, removing duplicates, and dealing with outliers to ensure the accuracy of the data. The final product was a cleaned dataset that can be used for further analysis and modeling, providing valuable information for researchers, policymakers, and anyone interested in the Nashville housing market.

### COVID-19 ###
This project utilized SQL to explore a COVID-19 dataset, with the aim of gaining insights into the spread and impact of the virus. The project involved cleaning and transforming the data using SQL queries, to identify patterns and trends in the data. Various statistical analyses and aggregations were performed, and data visualizations were created to help communicate the findings.

### Movie Correlation ###
This project utilized Python to conduct an analysis of a movie dataset with the goal of identifying the factors that impact a movie's gross revenue. The project involved performing various data cleaning tasks, such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. Data visualizations were created using seaborn and matplotlib to explore the distribution and correlation of the data.

### Amazon Web Scraper ###
This Python project scrapes data on a specific product from Amazon.com every 24 hours, and saves the data on a CSV file. The project checks the price of the product, and if it falls below a certain threshold, an email notification is sent to the user, alerting them to the price drop. The project utilizes web scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup to extract data on the product, and uses pandas to store and manipulate the data in a dataframe.
